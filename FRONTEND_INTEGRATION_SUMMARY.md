# Frontend Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the frontend with the Laravel backend API, implementing authentication, role-based access control, and full CRUD operations for products, users, and cart management.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System
- **Updated Auth Slice**: Replaced mock authentication with real API integration
- **Token Management**: Implemented proper token storage and refresh logic
- **Auth Guard Component**: Created role-based route protection
- **Login/Register Forms**: Connected to backend API endpoints

### 2. API Integration
- **Base API Setup**: Configured RTK Query with authentication headers
- **Auth API**: Login, register, logout, and user profile endpoints
- **Products API**: Full CRUD operations with filtering and pagination
- **Cart API**: Add, update, remove items with proper customer authentication
- **Users API**: Admin user management with role and privilege controls

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Dashboard**: Protected with admin role requirement
- **Cart Access**: Restricted to customers only
- **User Management**: Admin can create, update, and manage user roles
- **Product Management**: Staff users can manage products based on privileges

### 4. Component Updates
- **Navbar**: Shows user info, role-based navigation, proper logout
- **Product Cards**: Add to cart functionality with authentication checks
- **Cart Page**: Real-time cart management with API integration
- **Admin Dashboard**: Live metrics and data from backend

### 5. Data Flow
- **Products**: Fetched from `/api/products` with filtering and pagination
- **Users**: Admin can manage users via `/api/admin/users`
- **Customers**: Admin can manage customers via `/api/admin/customers`
- **Cart**: Customer cart operations via `/api/cart/*` endpoints

## Authentication Flow
1. User signs up → Role automatically set to 'customer'
2. User signs in → Token stored, user data fetched
3. Protected routes check authentication and roles
4. API calls include Bearer token in headers
5. Token refresh handled automatically

## Role Permissions
- **Customer**: Can view products, manage cart, view profile
- **Staff**: Can manage products (based on privileges), view dashboard
- **Admin**: Full access to all features, user management, metrics
